The data set is based on a questionnaire on attitudes towards the Internet. It
consists of evaluations of 22 statements about the Internet by 281 students at
Erasmus University Rotterdam. These data were gathered around 2002
before the wide availability of broadband Internet access in the Netherlands.
The statements were evaluated using a seven-point Likert scale, ranging
from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree).

We would like to thank Peter Verhoef for making these data available.

Each variable (statement) is coded as follows:

1. Completely disagree \cr
2. Disagree \cr
3. Slightly disagree \cr
4. Neutral \cr
5. Slightly agree \cr
6. Agree \cr
7. Completely agree \cr
